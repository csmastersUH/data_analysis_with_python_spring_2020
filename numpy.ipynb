    "# NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "[NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/) is a Python library for handling multi-dimensional arrays. It contains both the data structures needed for the storing and accessing arrays, and operations and functions for computation using these arrays. Although the arrays are usually used for storing numbers, other type of data can be stored as well, such as strings. Unlike lists in core Python, NumPy's fundamental data structure, the array, must have the same data type for all its elements. The homogeneity of arrays allows highly optimized functions that use arrays as their inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several uses for high-dimensional arrays in data analysis. For instance, they can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* store matrices, solve systems of linear equations, find eigenvalues/vectors, find matrix decompositions, and solve other problems familiar from linear algebra\n",
    "* store multi-dimensional measurement data. For example, an element `a[i,j]` in a 2-dimensional array might store the temperature $t_{ij}$ measured at coordinates i, j on a 2-dimension surface.\n",
    "* images and videos can be represented as NumPy arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * a gray-scale image can be represented as a two dimensional array\n",
    "  * a color image can be represented as a three dimensional image, the third dimension contains the color components red, green, and blue\n",
    "  * a color video can be represented as a four dimensional array\n",
    "* a 2-dimensional table might store a sequence of *samples*, and each sample might be divided into *features*. For example, we could measure the weather conditions once per day, and the conditions could include the temperature, direction and speed of wind, and the amount of rain. Then we would have one sample per day, and the features would be the temperature, wind, and rain. In the standard representation of this kind of tabular data, the rows corresponds to samples and the columns correspond to features. We see more of this kind of data in the chapters on Pandas and Scikit-learn.\n",

    "Write function `multiplication_table` that gets a positive integer `n` as parameter. The function should return an array with shape (n,n). The element at index `(i,j)` should be `i*j`. Don't use `for` loops! In your solution, rely on broadcasting, the `np.arange` function, reshaping and vectorized operators. Example of usage:\n",
