    "Regression analysis tries to explain relationships between variables. One of these variables, called dependend variable, is what we want to \"explain\" using one or more *explanatory variables*. In linear regression we assume that the dependent variable can be, approximately, expressed as a linear combination of the explanatory variables. As a simple example, we might have dependent variable height and an explanatory variable age. The age of a person can quite well explain the height of a person, and this relationship is approximately linear for kids (ages between 1 and 16). Another way of thinking about regression is fitting a curve to the observed data points. If we have only one explanatory variable, then this is easy to visualize, as we shall see below.\n",
