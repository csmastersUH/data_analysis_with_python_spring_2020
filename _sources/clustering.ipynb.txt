    "Clustering is one of the types of unsupervised learning. It is similar to classification: the aim is to give a label to each data point. However, unlike in classification, we are not given any examples of labels associated with the data points. We must infer from the data, which data points belong to the same cluster. This can be achieved using some notion of distance between the data points. Data points in the same cluster are somehow close to each other.\n",

    "* any point in a cluster is closer to its centre than to a centre of any other cluster\n",
