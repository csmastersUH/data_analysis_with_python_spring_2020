    "*Classification* is one form of supervised learning. The aim is to annotate all data points with a label. Those points that have the same label belong to the same class. There can be two or more labels. For example, a lifeform can be classified (coarsely) with labels animal, plant, fungi, archaea, bacteria, protozoa, and chromista. The data points are observed to have certain features that can be used to predict their labels. For example, if it is has feathers, then it is most likely an animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning an algorithm is first given a training set of data points with their features and labels. Then the algorithm learns from these features and labels a (probabilistic) model, which can afterwards be used to predict the labels of previously unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Naive Bayes classification* is a fast and simple to understand classification method. Its speed is due to some simplifications we make about the underlying probability distributions, namely, the assumption about the independence of features. Yet, it can be quite powerful, especially when there are enough features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
