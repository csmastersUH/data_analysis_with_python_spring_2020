    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis is an unsupervised learning method that tries to detect the directions in which the vector formed data varies most. It first finds the direction of highest variance, and then proceeds to discover directions of highest variance that are orthogonal to those direction already found. So, for n dimensional data, it returns, by default, n orthogonal directions and the corresponding variances. These directions are called *pricipal axes*, and if we project a data point to these axes, we get the *principal components* of each axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use another terminology, the set of principal axes forms a base for the vector space where the data points reside, and the principal components are the coordinates of the data points in this new coordinate system. The `PCA` class in the scikit-learn library has a `transform` method, which transforms data to this new coordinate system.\n",
