    "In the NumPy section we dealt with some arrays, whose columns had each a special meaning. For example, the column number 0 could contain values interpreted as years, and column 1 could contain a month, and so on. It is possible to handle the data this way, but in can be hard to remember, which column number corresponds to which variable. Especially, if you later remove some column from the array, then the numbering of the remaining columns changes. One solution to this is to give a descriptive name to each column. These column names stay fixed and attached to their corresponding columns, even if we remove some of the columns. In addition, the rows can be given names as well, these are called *indices* in Pandas.\n",
